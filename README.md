## Search information about countries in [REST Countries](https://restcountries.eu/)

<img src="promoForREADME.gif" width="500px">

You can search information about countries
[here](https://erastfandorin.github.io/goit-js-hw-12-countries/)

In this project I mastered:

- vanilla JavaScript
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/)
- [PNotify](https://sciactive.com/pnotify/)

All writing code are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by
[webpack-starter-kit](https://github.com/luxplanjay/webpack-starter-kit).

You can run this project locally just do:

1. clone branch `master` with
   `git clone https://github.com/erastfandorin/goit-js-hw-12-countries` or fork
   it and then clone it from your forked repo
1. `cd goit-js-hw-12-countries`
1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
